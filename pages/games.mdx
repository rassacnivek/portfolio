# Games

## I have always been a big tryharder in every game I have ever played and liked, and my username is *Moga*.
\
I'm an eager gamer since my childhood and I spent the last 20 years grinding every game that I touched. From all the Playstation ever made to my computer, passing by my mobile phone too, I love to compete myself and the community of each game I play.
\
\
All these games allowed me to perfect my game sense, and I feel like a great shout caller thanks to this.
\
\
Nowadays, because i founded my own family, my playing time reduced a bit, but I still find some time to continue mastering, or even discover new videos games.
