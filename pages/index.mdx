## I'm a *fullstack engineer* with a perfectionist sense.
\
Since my childhood, I have always had a passion for everything that relates to computers and the IT, and it kept growing over the years.
Thus on a daily basis I am always looking for new ways to develop, frontend design on websites like 
<ExternalLink link="https://dribbble.com/" text="Dribbble"/> or updates and stuff on frontend and backend development on websites like <ExternalLink link="https://thisweekinreact.com/" text="React Hebdo"/> or <ExternalLink link="https://github.com/trending" text="Github trending section"/>.
\
\
I'm always searching new ways to progress in everything i do in life in order to get the best results, whether it's gaming, work or even sports.

### Workflow
It's been 5 years that im coding in <ExternalLink link="https://www.php.net/" text="PHP"/> including around 2 years with <ExternalLink link="https://symfony.com/" text="Symfony"/> at work. I have worked also with <ExternalLink link="https://reactjs.org/" text="React"/> for 6 months at work but each of my side projects are made with it.
\
I also experienced the a main React frameworks: <ExternalLink link="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" text="Gatsby"/> and this site made me get into <ExternalLink link="https://nextjs.org/" text="Next"/>.
Both projects are available on my <ExternalLink link="https://github.com/rassacnivek" text="Github"/> profile.
\
\
For my backend websites, I have always used CSS3 in order to style my applications and for my frontend websites, I have always used <ExternalLink link="https://sass-lang.com/" text="SASS"/> but I took advantage of this website to start working with <ExternalLink link="https://tailwindcss.com/" text="Tailwind"/>.
It is way more consistent and maintainable than standard CSS.
\
\
During the development phase, everything is cleaned up using ESLint and Prettier.
At the end, I tend to ship projects with <ExternalLink link="https://vercel.com/" text="Vercel"/> as it takes care of everything (from SSL encryption to asset compression and cache invalidation). For websites using API, i tend to use <ExternalLink link="https://www.netlify.com/" text="Netlify"/>

### Misc
Here are some technologies I had to use among my numerous projects:
\
#### Frontend
<ExternalLink link="https://reactjs.org/" text="React"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://styled-components.com/" text="Styled components"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://jquery.com/" text="jQuery"/>

#### Backend
<ExternalLink link="https://php.net/" text="PHP"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://symfony.com/" text="Symfony"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://nodejs.org/" text="Node"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://www.mysql.com/" text="MySQL"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://www.postgresql.org/" text="PostgreSQL"/>, 

#### Self formation
Basics of <ExternalLink link="https://www.python.org/" text="Python"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://angular.io/" text="Angular"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://flutter.dev/" text="Flutter"/>, <ExternalLink link="https://vuejs.org/" text="VueJS"/>

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
