# Resume

## I’m currently working as a *consultant* at <ExternalLink link="https://www.solutec.fr/" text="Solutec" size="18" />, a SSII company specialized in engineering, consulting and IT services.

### Summary

I began my developer journey with a 2-years apprenticeship as a full-stack developer at <ExternalLink link="https://www.trefle-applications.com/" text="Trèfle Applications"/>, a subsidiary of the <ExternalLink link="https://www.groupetrefle.com/" text="Groupe Trèfle"/>. My main focus was to maintain the main internal website of the Groupe Trèfle which gathered the functionalities of an Entreprise Resource Planning (ERP) and a Customer Relationship Management (CRM), both created and developed from scratch by Trèfle Applications.

Then I joined, for a 1-year apprenticeship as a full-stack developer, Run Services, an insurance brokerage subsidiary of <ExternalLink link="https://axa.fr/" text="AXA"/>, and my main mission was to update the way the APIs were made, I had the chance a rework entirely the API system made before. We saw that all the sites Run Services made were using the same client form, so I had to make them using the same API, with web services next to it for special informations, like the price calculation or the acceptance of the customer file.

Finally, I had the oportunity to work at Solutec as consultant, and I will describe all my different missions right after.
